	<body>
	<P>The design of Limaki follows the
principle of separation of concerns. Data and visual model are
separated, similar to the model-view-controller design pattern. In a
further step, the view part of the pattern is itself modeled after
mvc-pattern to separate visual models from concrete displays. Modular
view controllers are used to handle user input in a flexible and
reusable fashion. 
</P>
	Graph<br />
	The Graph classes are implemented using <span class="code">ICollection</span> and <span class="code">IDictionary</span> instances to store the
nodes and edges.
	</body>
	
	<P>The <span class="code">Limaki.Graphs</span> are 
generic <span class="code">Graph</span> structures for data and visual models. A generic <span class="code">Edge</span>
interface represents the members of graphs.</P>
