<P><span class="code">Limada</span> is a framework for building
interactive information visualization applications.</P>
<P>The design of Limada follows the principle of separation of concerns. 
Limadas architecture is based on layers. 
Each layer represents a logical group of components.</P>
<p>There are four layers in limada:</p>

<p>The <b>presentation layer</b> contains components for 
visualizing the model and interacting with the user. This layer is divided into several sublayers:<br/>
- the Graphics-Layers: this layer provides basic graphic structures like points, rectangles and operations on them. 
It contains the media to draw like pen, font, color. 
A Shape is a structure to describe a geometric form. 
A Style is a composition of medias. 
A Painter is responsible for rendering a Shape with a given Style to a Surface.<br />
- the Visuals-Layer: A Visual is a graphic representations of a model-entity. 
Visuals are composed of a Shape, a Style and a data object. A Scene is a surface where visuals are drawn.
Visuals are agnostic to a special data model.<br/>
The core components of the Graphics- and Widget-Layer are independent from a concrete visual framework like GDI or WPF. 
To realize a presentation layer with a concrete framework a small, framework-specific graphic mapping layer is needed.</p>

<p>The <b>model layer</b> contains Things and Links. 
A <span class="code">Thing</span> is a vertice (or node) of a graph, a Link connects Things. 
A ThingGraph acts as a facade to process operations on the entities.</p>

<p>The <b>mapping layer</b> connects the model with the view. 
This is realized with a <span class="code">GraphPair</span>.<br />
A GraphPair is a facade on two Graphs of different types, Graph&lt;Widget&gt; and Graph&lt;Thing&gt;. 
To the presentation layer it appears as a Graph&lt;Widget&gt;, 
but every operation is performed on the Graph&lt;Thing&gt; too.  
So a visual abstraction of the model can be done by creating a GraphPair&lt;Widget, Thing&gt;.

<P>The <b>data layer</b> provides Graphs backed by Databases.</P>
