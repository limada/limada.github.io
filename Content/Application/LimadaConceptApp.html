    <P>With limada::concept you can draw, edit and store concept maps. A
concept map is a diagram showing the relationships among concepts.
They are graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge.
They include concepts, usually enclosed in circles or boxes of some
type, and relationships between concepts indicated by a connecting
line linking two concepts.</P>
<P>Concepts can be connected with labeled arrows. The relationship
between concepts can be articulated in linking phrases, e.g., &quot;gives
rise to&quot;, &quot;results in&quot;, &quot;is required by,&quot; or
&quot;contributes to&quot;.</P>
<P>Concept maps are similar to mind maps, but give more freedom, as
mind maps are often restricted to radial hierarchies and tree
structures.</P>

maps side by side by clicking on the sheet view-button in the
