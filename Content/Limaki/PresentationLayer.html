<H3>Graphics-Layer</H3>
<P><span class="code">Point, Size, Rectangle, Color, Pen, Font</span> are the graphic primitives. 
These are independent implementations, no dependency of System.Graphics or System.Windows. 
The intention is the reusability of the framework in different graphic environments.</P>
<P>A <span class="code">Shape</span> is a structure to describe a geometric form, like a RectangleShape or a LineShape.
It does not contain any code how to render it nor code about the media like color, pen or font.</P>
<P>A <span class="code">Style</span> is a composition of medias, like Font, Pen or Color. 
Styles are grouped in StyleSheets.</P>
<P>A <span class="code">Painter</span> is responsible for rendering a Shape with a given Style to a Surface. 
The graphics.layer only contains an abstract painter class and a painter interface. 
Concrete painters have to be provided by an concrete graphics layer on a given framework, 
eg. System.Graphics.</P>
<P>A <span class="code">PainterFacory</span> is used to get a concrete Painter for a Shape. 
The concrete graphics layer is responsible to instrument the PainterFactory with appropriate Painters.</P>
<P>The <span class="code">Graphics.UI</span>-namespace provides several interfaces and abstract classes for user interaction.</P>

<H3>Presenter-Layer</H3>
<P><span class="code">Visuals</span> are providing access to visual
attributes. A <span class="code">Visual</span> is a generic data structure which has a <span class="code">Shape</span>,
a <span class="code">Style</span> and a generic Data property. An <span class="code">VisualEdge</span> is an instance
representing a <span class="code">Visual&lt;Edge&gt;</span>.</P>

<P>A <span class="code">Scene</span> wraps a <span class="code">Graph&lt;Visual&gt;</span> and a
spatial index, providing fast access to the location of Visuals. A
Scene has methods for hit-tests, iterations over Visuals contained in
an area, and the overall bounds of the Visuals contained in the
Graph. A Scene provides a <span class="code">Command</span>-Queue as a central place to gather
operations on Visuals to be performed as an Unit of Work. 
</P>

<P>Specific visual appearance is provided
by a <span class="code">Layout</span>. A Layout sets the appropriate Style, determines the
initial Shape, Size and Location of Visuals in a Scene. The Layout
uses a <span class="code">Router</span> to set the start- and endpoints of a VisualEdge.</P>

<P>The actual appearance of Visual
instances are determined by <span class="code">Renderers</span>. A Renderer is responsible for
drawing Visual.Data and Visual.Shape with the appropriate Style. For
this task a Renderer uses <span class="code">Painter</span>s. Which Painter to use for a given
Shape or Data is determined by a <span class="code">PainterFactory</span>, which is asked for
the appropriate Painter each time a Shape or Data is to be rendered.</P>

<P>A <span class="code">Layer</span> is responsible to draw a Scene.
It acts as a camera onto the contents of the Scene. The Layer draws
all the widgets within its current view, and realizes panning and
zooming.</P>

<P>An <span class="code">Action</span> transforms a user interaction
into a <span class="code">Command</span>. With Actions moving, resizing, deleting, editing and
so on are realized. <code>Actions</code> are bundled in an <span class="code">EventControler</span>, which
calls Actions according to the events fired by the user-interface.
</P>

<P>The <span class="code">SceneControler</span> is the mediator
between Layout, Scene.CommandQueue and invalidation of the underlying
Control. Its methods are called on initializing the Control and after
each bundled execution of Actions by the EventControler. In this call
it is responsible for executing all pending Commands in the queue,
calculating the appropriate invalidation area of the Control, and
calling the Invalidate-method of the Control.</P>

<P>The <span class="code">VisualsDisplay</span> bundles all that
separated classes and modules as a user control. It paints a Scene
with a Layer, feeds the Camera with appropriate panning information,
and calls the EventControler in case of user interaction.</P>

<H3>GDI-Layer</H3>
<P>This very thin layer implements some 
abstract classes or interfaces of the Graphics- and Presenterlayer 
with the use of System.Drawing.</P>

<H3>Xwt-Drawing-Layer</H3>
<P>This very thin layer implements some 
abstract classes or interfaces of the Graphics- and Presenterlayer 
with the use of Xwt.Drawing. It is going to replace the GDI-Layer</P>

<H3>WinForm-Layer</H3>
<P>This layer implements some abstract classes or interfaces of 
the Graphics- and Presenterlayer with the use of System.Windows.Forms.</P>

<H3>Xwt-Widget-Layer</H3>
<P>This layer implements some abstract classes or interfaces of 
the Graphics- and Presenterlayer with the use of Widget-Classes of Xwt. In the future, ist should replace the Winform-Layer</P>

<P>Remark: The design of Limaki.View is
loosely based upon the information visualization reference model, a
software architecture pattern that breaks up the visualization
process into a series of discrete steps.</P>
